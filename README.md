Projects based on convolutional neural networks


<p>Convolutional neural networks are another type of neural networks. With their help, you can recognize objects in the image.
The first convolutional neural network AlexNet at the ImageNet competition in 2012 beat all the classical algorithms. In 2011, the error rate was 25.8, but AlexNet was able to give a result of 15.3, which allowed to draw attention to convolutional networks.
In 2021, the CoAtNet-7 convolutional neural network won and showed a result of 90.88% accuracy.</p>

<p>Convolutional networks are based on convolution - the application of filters that show whether a certain element is in this image.</p>
